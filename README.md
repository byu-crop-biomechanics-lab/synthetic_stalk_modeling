# synthetic_stalk_modeling
This repository was created for the development of a parameterized model of the maize stalk.
As of May 4, 2020, the model only accounts for transverse loading of the cross-section, an approximation of the loads experienced by the cross-section during bending.
Further work is being done to test the model's fidelity for other loading paradigms, including bending, torsion, and tension/compression.

Additionally, this repository contains some initial work using the cross-sectional model as a basis for parameterizing the full 3-dimensional stalk.

Primary development by Ryan A. Larson as part of a Master's thesis in Mechanical Engineering at Brigham Young University.
